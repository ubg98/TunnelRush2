#R13
So we meet again.

It's been a while, did you miss me?
#L01
The voice in my head...

I remember...
#R13
Technically not in your head,
but no matter.

I have a surprise for you.
#R13
Since you have proved to be
such a talented switcher,
I have granted you the ability
to create your own levels.
#L01
Levels...?
#R13
Yes, levels, such as the one you
just finished.
There are thousands more, created
by others such as yourself.
#L01
Who... are you?
#R13
Ah, I am getting tired of that old
question.
I am here to help, and that is all 
you need to know for now.
#L01
I saw someone else in the level.
She was called Rayna, I think.
#R13
You WHAT?!
How did she... ahem... 

Pay no attention to her.
#R13
Focus on your mission.

Do not let yourself be distracted by
these trivialities.
#R13
If you would like to create a level, 
try other user's levels, or compete
with friends, press the Main Menu or
pause button at any time.
#R13
Otherwise, prepare for the next level.

It will not be so easy.
#L01
