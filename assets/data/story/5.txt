Uh, who's this?
#R17
It's the confused dude I passed
by a while ago.

So, remember your name yet?
#L01
Not really. But I think I
recognize these flying cities 
from somewhere...
#R17
That's good, you're recovering
some of your memory.
They're orbital cities, we all used
to live in one before we escaped.
#L01
!!!
#R04
You sure you don't remember
anything else about yourself?

You seem familiar somehow...
#L01
Not really, I'm still trying
to piece everything together.
#R04
That's cool, no sense thinking
about it too much.
#R17
Dragin, would you stop saying that!?
We must all think about it, if we
are to find a way out of here!
#R04
I mean, I like running fast, gravity
switching, completing the challenges.

Why's that so bad?
#R17
Argh, you just don't get it!!!

Anyway, we've dawdled for long
enough. See you later, dude!
#R04
Yeah, gotta run, haha!
